## 📖 **Introduction**
**[Library Name]** is a .NET library designed to simplify PayPal integration. With just a few steps, you can accept payments, handle payment notifications, and automate processes like order management and shipping address capture.

## 🔧 **PayPalIpnMiddleware**
The `PayPalIpnMiddleware` allows you to handle PayPal Instant Payment Notifications (IPN). This middleware verifies incoming notifications and triggers an event when a payment is successfully completed.

### How to Configure IPN Notifications
1. Log in to your PayPal account.
2. Navigate to **Account Settings > Instant Payment Notifications (IPN)**.
3. Set the notification URL to point to your `/ipn` endpoint (e.g., `https://yourdomain.com/ipn`).
4. Save the changes.

For more details, refer to the [official PayPal documentation](https://developer.paypal.com/docs/api-basics/notifications/ipn/).

### Middleware Usage Example
Here is an example of how to use the `PayPalIpnMiddleware` in your application:

'''csharp

var app = builder.Build();

// user for PayPal IPN validation:
// in your program.cs file you can use this code to set an event (example: OnPaymentCompleted) that will be executed at every payment.
app.UseMiddleware<PayPal.PayPalIpnMiddleware>(Events.OnPaymentCompleted);

'''
### Event Handling

You can handle the payment success event by subscribing to the `OnPaymentCompleted` event. This allows you to perform actions like updating order status, sending confirmation emails, etc.

### Example Event Handler
Here is an example of how to handle the payment success event:
'''csharp
public class Events
{
	static internal void OnPaymentCompleted(Dictionary<string, string> instantPaymentNotificationData)
        {
            // If the payment is completed, extract transaction details
            var transactionId = instantPaymentNotificationData["txn_id"]; // Transaction ID from PayPal
            var id = instantPaymentNotificationData["custom"]; // Custom field set in the payment link
            var amount = instantPaymentNotificationData["mc_gross"]; // Gross amount of the transaction
            Debug.WriteLine($"Payment completed. Transaction ID: {transactionId}, Custom ID: {id}, Amount: {amount}");            
        }
}
'''
